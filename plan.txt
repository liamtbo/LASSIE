clustering
    Prepare data
        format data
            figure out which two columns make up force vs resistance graph
            figure out how to handle temporal shifts (do i have to handle temporal shifts? x-axis is depth)
                make graph continuous
                    create new dataset with constant x-axis, use euclidean distance as distance metrix
                keep temporal shifts
                    use DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) distance metric
            use moving average to remove noise
            normalize those columns
            goal: for each data file calulcate
        clean data
            address nan
            numerical
        standardize/normalize data

    dimension reduction of data choice
        feature extraction
            statistical measures
            derivatives
        latent representations
            auto-encoder

    model choice
        k-means clustering
        heirarchical clustering

    model parameter experimentation

    data recording

Using clustering for prediction
    we have already calculated clusters from above
    receive new data point in feild
    clean the same as above
    calculate distance from the new data point to each centroid calculated during prior clustering
    keep track of what the nearest cluster is
        ex: if previous point is close to cluster1 and the next data point becomes closer to cluster2 we say robot dog is leaving env 1 and entering env 2
        perhaps track momentum, direction of multiple points in direct sequence may increase certainty of heading to a new env
        must be a gradinet between environment right?
