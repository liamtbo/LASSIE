General formatting notes
    if multiple slides per section keep the section header at top and create a subheader for each new slide
    figure out gif of pca plots (obs) then video to gif converter

[ ] data set (new slide)
    - what data set is (L3, L2)
    - total number of data points,
    - total number of labeled data points
    - count of each label
    - ws23' + ws'25
    - using traveler leg 
[ ] potential new slide about assumption of spherical clustering
[ ] Feature selection slide
    - use subplots to display perhaps
    - all axis's size need to be the same, no matter what
    - include what's normalized
        - (maybe) use pythagoream theorem to get the length of a line
        - depth**2 + res**2 = (len(line))**2
        - use this to normalize things like num peaks (num peaks per one unit of length)
        - create a slide about this
        - why not normalize by simply max depth?
            - maybe we just do by depth
        - why not normalize by simply max resistance?
    - use same plot (#4) if possible for all examples
    - for showing curve shape
        - show a -- < - < + < ++ example plots
        - make a slide showing cristina why i think it's important (seperation of blue and yellow curves)
[ ] feature correlation matrix slide
    - add in why it's imporant to keep in high correlation
        - example: two curves of same max depth but different resistance's (want this seperation to be known)
[ ] marions surface classification 
    - either find a ws loose sand photo or dump the stock one
[ ] marions pseudo labeling (corrected)
    - show only the labeled data 
    - show the corrected pseudo labeling
    - discuss how purple centoid is at origin
    - points seem to be normally distributed (dark maybe isn't a valid classificaiton)
        - think through logic on near origin -> normally distriuted -> normal sampling -> dark surface not correlated to ground type?
        - write out "hypothesis: ..." in slide
[ ] marions pseudo labeling (corrected) with es-d removed
[ ] marions pseudo labeling (not corrected) with curves that moved keeping original color
[ ] display images of clusters that moved
[ ] plot transect and plot cluster colors based on pseudo labeling (stretch goal lets do it!)
