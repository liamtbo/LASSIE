thoughts:
    artificially icnrease labeled data set
        for each label, find mean and variance
    k-nearest neighbors 
    fixing class imbalance
    
help ian with his figure is highest priority - so that i get my name on the paper

Long-term goals:
    metric for "best clustering"
        variance
        std
    try diff clustering algos, mean, knn, radius-nn
    update clustering feature list

    use metric to test out best feature list
        grid search on following:
            num of features
            num type of features
            different algorithms
            differ params for each algorithm
    labeled data
        iterative improvements of morphological labels
        predictive capability on WS25
            making more labeled data easier
            catching mistakes

current goal:
    matric for optimal features
        try 
    metric for "best clustering"
        how many of the labeled data are cateogorized incorrectly
        variance within a label (some featurs may spread this out, some may group labels better)
        using non-labeled clustering as ground truth somehow?
