    ian's figures
        change text to times new roman (done)
        when i get the rest of images, line them up in a row by location, takingup two columns
        fill in text where he's written my name

        plot force depth
            status: decode_cont.py decoded binary file to csv file, now stiffness_map should generate the plot, but no "...higher_level" named file created - waiting on jeongwoo
            
            data is in ian's box
            2025-08-06_074335_Ws25_aug_06_loc_2a-1_t1_part2
                contains force depth binary data & csv where each row is 
                it's own intrusion
            get plots of diff intrusions (specified in slack)
                crawl is in ws25_aug_07_loc_1a-1_t1_crawl_stiffness.svg
                trot(?) is in ws25_aug_06_loc_2a-1_t1_trotstiffness.png in the dark blue section towards beggining
                    blue section crosses two different types of surface
                    get one pen from each extreme of dark blue section bc they're different intrusions
            use shipengs code to convert binary to csv or whatever for each force depth plot

    send out email chain about slack thing
    remove largest force drop and try correlate dthingd
    slack cristina about learning based course and kinematics being moved
    clean up lassie code
    follow up with marion (new clustering result)
    follow up with Doug (corr results with largest force drop num_peaks, rsquaredd, revised elbow plot i.e. get rid of flat partsSS)



TODO 9/9
    slack message about force drop seperation (done)
    complete ians figures for him - details in chat (done)
    timeline for cristina (done)
        send slack message
    send in slack channel and link to it in email chai
    reach out about largest force drop
    include pseudo label result
    fisher test results
    maybe slide deck (not long) but if i do include tldr 

    asking them for largest force drop (not good metric but getting good results)

    timeline - slack over to cristina !!! for clustering result  (done)
