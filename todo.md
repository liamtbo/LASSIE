    dataset
        coloring doesn't line up with rest of slides
        make it uniform
    feature selection - example plots
        looks great!
    feature selection - correlation matrix
        0.5 threshold, back up with reasoning, look into 0.6
    feature selection - correlation matrix analysis
        Add another exception or remove (max_dep or max_resistance)
        possibly split into two different slides to reduce wording
    pca explanation
        possibly split into two slides
        think about how to add in a principla component descirption of each of marion's labels
    add in image analysis

Ian Michael practice
    Priority! LOCATE IMAGES
    general
        use animations to and red boxed to walk through a slide
        no 3d plot spins on a slide
        state problem and this as a solution
        add slide nums
    marions surface classifications
        make it more obvious plot is associated to surface name (gray background)
        write out fill names like bubbly
    feature engineering
        ian asked why these
        it's a lot to look at, and names are small on plot
        split featues into categories
    correlation matrix (analysis) semi -helpful (keep in)
    PCA plot
        explanation is very complicated
        didn't get much out of 3d plot graphics (only have rotating 3d plot by itself on one slide)
        since 3d plot explanation is very complicated, either remove explanation or make it like how I explained it to cristina originally
    pseudo labeling steps
        use animations to walk through slide
    marion's pseudo labeling
        give a single plot example of curves switching labels
        talk about function doesn't have enough data to accurately represent the training data as a reason
