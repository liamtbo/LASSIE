preprocessing
    Load in all files into df list
    simultaneously, create parallel array of file names
    create a y-label simulatanrously while loading in files using dictioanry value
    process normally
    make way to save list maybe a one col df to save easily
featue extraction
    zip up file_labels and labled files into a dict
    load in df_list as well as parallel array of files labels
    extract features of df_list which makes a single representation_df
    add Labled files and file_labels columns to representation_df
clustering
    goal 1: just cluster the labled data
        create new clustering code blocks
        mask out non-labled rows in representation list
        feed these results to clustering algorithms and plot
    goal 2: cluster the data normally, then apply the known labels to it
        cluster all data normally,
        plot clusters like usual (cluster covers = graidents of blue)
        mask out so we just have Labled representations
        plot these masked out representations (cluster colors based on label and make it purple gradient)


preprocessing
    process files like normal, save them with their default names
feature extraction
    load data in, keep a parallel array of file names
    extract features like normal
    combine the into one df and save it
clustering
    goal 1: just cluster the labled data
        use the list of labled data file names to mask out the represnetation df using col with their names
